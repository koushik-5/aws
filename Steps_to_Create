Project Title:

SET UP EC2 AUTO SCALING WITH ALB PATH BASED ROUTING

Steps of Procedure and Output:
------------------------------------------

Step-01:
Login to AWS Console and Go to Amazon VPC, now create a new VPC.
Name your VPC ad auto-scaling.

Step-02:
In right menu you can see Subnets go to it and create a subnet.Create 4 different subnets.

Step-03:
Go to Internet Gateway and create an Internet Gateway name it as autoscaling-igw.

Step-04:
Now attach the internet gateway to created VPC.

Step-05:
Now once go to all the subnets created are in available state.Click any subnet and edit its route table.
Update the route table for all the subnets it connected.

Step-06:
Create a Security Group named as autoscaling-sg

Step-07:
Now specify a target group
Now we are specifying the target group for application1.

Step-08:
We all done this for creating a Load Balancer.
After this fill the required things in LB creation and create a Load Balancer named alb-demo

Step-09:
Now create an instance to connect with our applications.Instance is successfully created.

Step-10:
Now open Putty to connect with the ec2-user.

Step-11:
Create an AMI Images for instances named as Application1 and Application2.

Step-12:
Now Launch Configuration in Auto Scaling and Now create it for application2.

Step-13:
Now create an Auto-scaling group for application1.

Step-14:
i. Create a target group for it.
ii. Edit the rules.
iii. Create separate rules for that the application will get by giving the path name continuing DNS name.

Step-15:
Create an auto-scaling group for application2.See the instances created for application2.

So, this works, Hence the setup of ec2 auto scaling with ALB path-based routing is successfully completed.
